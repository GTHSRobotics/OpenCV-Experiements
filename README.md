# OpenCV-Experiements
My Repo of OpenCV Expermenting.

## Disclaimer
This code is not meant for production use, and I'm sure isnt the best way to do these tasks. Im
still learning and just need a place to experiement with ideas. Ill do my best to comment and explain my thinking however!

## Running Examples

### Requirments
 - Python 3
 - NumPy (`pip3 install numpy`)
 - OpenCV (`pip3 install opencv-python`)
 - Images (`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzk9icjq-l3JQVdYM0ZuUTNXWlE?usp=sharing`)

### Downloading Images
Thanks to many generous folks on the [FTC Discord](https://discord.gg/8v3cbkj), we have made a public dataset of pictures of this year's FTC game. This images provide
many diffrent examples, in diffrent lighting and enviroments, perfect for testing CV. All the Python scripts have been configured (`image_path` varaible on the top of the scripts) to read from this data set. Simple [Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzk9icjq-l3JQVdYM0ZuUTNXWlE?usp=sharing) it and extract the files into `images/`. Then run the scripts either via your IDE or `python [script]`. 

### Running
Simple [Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzk9icjq-l3JQVdYM0ZuUTNXWlE?usp=sharing) it and extract the files into `images/`. Then run the scripts either via your IDE or `python [script]`. Press `q` to cycle to the next image. `ctrl + c` inside your terminal to close the script (or _stop button_ in PyCharm)

## `legacy` folder
This are old scripts I'm currently porting over and cleaning up. This do not support the image set above and most only read one image at a time.

## IDE
I recommend using PyCharm for running this only for the fact thats what
I have been using to develop this and it makes installing the requirements easy.
